# This is one of the project from the BA706 module to demonstarte the knowledge of SAAS and analyze the data for churn

The finding of this analysis from the business perspective is in order to minimize the number of customers who are withdrawing the use of credit cards with respective financial institutions, officials should focus on major customers who have revolving balance less than $634 and simultaneously the customer whose count of transactions per month is below 57. The marketing department can send some promotional messages or email to such customers so that they do not churn and are retained. This overall saves the time and money to be invested in all the credit card users and be effective as well.

Besides this, if the institution wants then they can focus on other groups of people based on gender, education, marital status and card type but these are just the minor groups for prioritizing than before having low revolving balance and transaction.
